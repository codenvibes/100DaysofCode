# Day 2
Beginner - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## Exercise 1 - Data Types
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

## Exercise 2 - BMI Calculator
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

Warning: you should convert the result to a whole number.

## Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

    You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input
```
56
```
Example Output
```
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
```
Hint:
1. There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
2. Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.
