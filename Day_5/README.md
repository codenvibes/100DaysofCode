## Exercise 1 - Average Height
File: [average_height.py](https://github.com/codenvibes/100DaysofCode/blob/master/Day_5/average_height.py)
</summary>

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = **1146**

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

**Important** You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

Example Input
```
156 178 165 171 187
```
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

Example Output
```
171
```

## Exercise 2 - High Score
File: [high_score.py](https://github.com/codenvibes/100DaysofCode/blob/master/Day_5/high_score.py)
</summary>

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

Example Input
```
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
```
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Example Output
```
The highest score in the class is: 91
```
Hint:

Think about the logic before writing code. How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?
